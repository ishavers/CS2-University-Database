# CS2-University-Database
A fake university database built for Fordham University using generated names and a future class schedule.
The database is navigated using text inputs. At any point you can enter 'back' to return to previous screen or 'end' to exit the program. 
Information is stored by either student or course and so you can search through either. 
You can edit a student's class schedule as well, 'add'ing and 'remove'ing a course based on it's CRN. 

aside: There are classes with well over the maximum amount of students currently allowed, but instead of removing students based on this they remain in the system because many classes were dropped in the class verification system.
